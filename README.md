A curated collection of end-to-end Data Warehouse projects built with modern cloud technologies. This portfolio demonstrates the complete lifecycle of data from ingestion to insightful reporting, implementing robust data architecture patterns like the **Medallion Architecture**.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Philosophy

This portfolio champions the **Modern Data Stack**, leveraging best-of-breed, cloud-native tools for scalability, reliability, and maintainability. The core design pattern across all projects is the **Medallion Architecture**, ensuring incremental data quality and governance.

### End-to-End Pipeline Architecture

### The Medallion Architecture In Practice

*   **üü§ Bronze Layer:** The landing zone. Raw data is ingested in its original format, ensuring immutability and historical traceability. *(Tools: Azure Data Factory, ADLS Gen2)*
*   **‚ö™ Silver Layer:** The single source of truth. Raw data is cleansed, standardized, deduplicated, and integrated into a structured, query-ready format (often a Data Vault or 3NF model). *(Tools: dbt, Snowflake)*
*   **üü° Gold Layer:** The consumption layer. Data is transformed into business-intuitive dimensional models (Star Schema) or highly aggregated datasets optimized for specific analytics and reporting needs. *(Tools: dbt, Snowflake)*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose & Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ingestion & Orchestration** | **Azure Data Factory**, **Apache Airflow** | Building scalable, fault-tolerant ELT pipelines with robust scheduling and monitoring. |
| **Cloud Storage** | **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2** | Cost-effective, highly available storage for raw and processed data in open formats (Parquet, Delta). |
| **Data Warehouse** | **Snowflake** | The core analytical database. Leveraged its separation of compute/storage, zero-copy cloning, and time travel for efficient development and testing. |
| **Transformation & Modeling** | **dbt (Data Build Tool)** | Applied software engineering practices (version control, modularity, testing) to data transformation. Built documented, maintainable, and tested SQL models. |
| **Source Database** | **Microsoft SQL Server** | Simulated enterprise-grade transactional systems as data sources. |
| **Visualization** | **Power BI** | Developed interactive dashboards to deliver actionable insights from the Gold layer data models. |
| **Version Control** | **Git** | All code is version-controlled, demonstrating collaboration and CI/CD readiness. |

## üìÇ Project Showcase

### Project 1: E-Commerce Sales Analytics Dashboard
**Objective:** Build a centralized data platform to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends.
*   **Sources:** SQL Server (Orders, Customers), CSV (Product Catalog), API (Shipping Data)
*   **Key Models:** `fct_orders`, `dim_customers`, `dim_products`, `dim_date`
*   **Transformations:** SCD Type 2 for customer attributes, revenue calculations, geographic enrichment.
*   **Outcome:** A Power BI dashboard providing views into YTD revenue, sales by region, and customer cohorts.


## üéØ Key Competencies Demonstrated

*   **End-to-End Pipeline Development:** Proven ability to own the entire data lifecycle, from source systems to production-ready dashboards.
*   **Cloud Data Engineering:** Hands-on expertise with major cloud providers (Azure) and SaaS platforms (Snowflake).
*   **Modern Data Stack Proficiency:** Deep practical knowledge of the industry's leading tools (ADF, dbt, Airflow, Snowflake).
*   **Data Modeling:** Designed and implemented both normalized (Silver) and dimensional (Gold) data models for optimal performance and usability.
*   **Data Quality & Reliability:** Engineered pipelines with built-in data validation, testing (using dbt tests), and monitoring for proactive issue detection.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Managed data warehouse schemas and transformation logic through version-controlled code (SQL, YAML, Python).
